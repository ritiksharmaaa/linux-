researcher 
cyber security  expert 
business 
normal people ( ya but they use in a very dffrent way .

ex- research 

researching relatedto trib 
or business where i want to invenst  i have to know what the perpective build around that .
what people see on that location . research into people and business entity . or just as reqular person .


my way to see : - in movie see see police have a informer to know what the happen in  there area  . here  information is alway available in public but not every have reach  to that info so office either use osint or who expert in osint . so the informaer do osint skill . they search collect analyse and give report to officer . 

another way is that tracking activity of a crimal group  by using mapping tool we see in mov people create a map and join each of them with thread  to understand what the happening . basic what ever herso observe and get on a decision is using osint skill . 
bascilly use say a  behaviour of spy developing by learning osint . 

you also see in movie a reporter doing osint on criminal gang and collected evvience and present in courct the crimal kill the reporter . 

or a humble employee who secretly collection information to the organisation who involve in some wrong activity . 

we also see in movie a img show case for some place which officaer find where it is . 


 to pratcie you see see random pic of place and try to find the actual location .
