what we learn : 

 what is cp network , how it work , what are the type of network , what is ip address and there type . role of port in networking .


what is compunter networking : - 

networking is a communcation between two or more machine and sharing of information  , software  , data are called computer networking . 

 is a bunch of concept are as below : - 
   
   commucnication : - sharing of information are called communication  , 

   share software : - sharing file : - sharing info ------ and the file which we pass is preserve somewhere that is called information predesevation : - 

   whene two sytem communcicate they using some protocal like tcp or udp http , and that protocal remember to securly tranfer data .  | security : - 

   sharing of hardware : - 
   
   sharing of data : - 


  this is whole things which came under computer netwroking : - 

 



how it networking work : - 

 ISP : - your internet provider are called ISP .

 what it do it provide internet to your ROUTER  : provide net to all sytem . 

  communication between i ISP AND ROUTER ; what haopening theire .
 
  ip : - is a address 

   so when router connected withh isp it provide ip adress to router . here isp give a public ip to router(  8.2.10.350 .03   ) and it has alreadu a private ip( 192.3.0.02.1 ) . anf than other device ehich connecte with router it also give ip address to each device . and the ip alloted basic on therfe private ip and add 


 example Isp -> give ip to router ( public ip and privateip(192. 0 .3.4.56. 1. )) 

  thant three device are connected so the router give ip address for each device bu adding 1 2 3 4 after there private ip .

  the ip provide by router to each device they dont have no existence in internet worrld it only work inside router , IMPORTNACE OF PUBLIC IT IS PREFFERE IN INTERNET WORLD 
  
  
  SUpose one of the device search google .com - > that what ever it send it create a packet of data send to router and router send this packet to internet .


SOURSE IP AND SYSTEM IP : -

  SOURSE IP : THE SYSTEM WGERE PACKET IS CREATE  basucly router public  ip . 
  system ip : - the destination of google .

 than it reach google it giv response two either deny or access for service .

  
 response came to Router Ip 

 ---------------------


Router alway send ARP request - Address resolution protocol ; than it ask to device who ic 129.0.23.01 those say i am it send the packet which came from gooogle . 



 ------------------------------types of network in netwroking ----------------


LAN : local area network 

MAN :  mwtropolitiona area Network 

WAN ; wide area network .


------------------LAN 


the device which connected to Router are called Local Area Network .


\
----------------------MAN 

same work when happen in big level are callled MAN  ex : router who provide internet to so many household , servers , building .



---------------------WAN

is a internet . isp , www ,is a wide area network 
\
wide area network provide internet to  so many contry : 




-------------------------IP ADDRESS ----------------------------------------------

ip = Internet Protocal Address 

IPv4  Address example : - 

  4 pair of byted 

17 . 172 . 224 .47 

 0000 , 0000 , 0000 , 0000 

each pair have 8 bits mean 1 bytes tottall 32 bit 

1 - pair tell which contry have a ip 
2 -  pair tell which state havea ip 
3 - tell which isp have have ip 
4 - tell which device 


how it waork ex : a crimal do cyber fraud :  - 

 so it ip is save in web log in log it record what it use swhat time and what a Ip 

thAN company reach to isp and ask which device have this ip -- than it tell this macaddress have this ip at that time 

what is difrence between IPv4 vs IPv6 


IPv4                                                    IPV6 

adress size 32 bit                                     128 bit 
address formate datted decimal Notation                hexadecimal Notainion 
192.159.252.76                                          3ffe;f200:0234:ab00:01:23:4567:890/abcd 

refeix notaion                                         prefix notation 
mean country state fix only isp and device change       3ffe;f200:0234:/48
192.149.0.0/24

number of Address 
2^32      4.7 billion                                  340 trillion 

souser have more than this so that whay v6 came 

static ip cretead problem                                           







-----------------------type of ip 

public private static dynamic 

public ip  : isp provide a public ip to you you hotspost and device which is connected .ip alway send who one hospot not who use it .

the who show all over internret . 


private : - the ip who generated by our router it called private . and outside router they dont have existence .


static ip and dynamic ip :

one time allotement and it can not change . like when we host overe site we have a static ip thats why it can not change . 

dynamic ip : - our smartphone have dynamic ip it can change it when you open airiplain model switch off than we have new ip .




role of port in networking : - 

suppose two machin communicate 

it has 

ip 122.168.123    -- 132.168.1.2.9 

they communcicate via protocal tcp udp they nedd port 

port is just like a road 

so over machine have lot of port also same in other 

so we ahve to give port to use which port you have to use to communcicate 


so we have lot of port 

ex 

300 

20 

23

443 

this are port or path to communicate . one they choose or use one port so they have alway communcate with those paticular port .



TOTAL PORT : - 65000+ 
STATE OPEN AND CLOSE AND FILTER 

well know port 0-1023 : this port are define this can use by http and many more .

registered 1024 - 49151  they aer register with paticaur oraganization 

dynamix port 49152-65535 : - assign anyone 



default port : - 

port  protocol   application 
20 -   tcp - ftp data 
21   tcp     - ftp - control 
22    tcp     - ssh 
25    tcp    smtp 
53    tcp udp     Dns 
80    tcp          http www
110   tcp       pop3 
443   tcp       ssl
