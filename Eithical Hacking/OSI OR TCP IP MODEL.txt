what is OSI , how it work , what is tcp and ip , how it work ,  osi vs tcp ip 



waht is osi model : - open system interconnection model 

defien function in 7 layer and standarize communcation 

it work with bottom to up 


working 



7 layers : - 

 appication                             same for all 
presentation 

session 
trnasport
 network
data layer 
physical layer '
client                                 server 


this help in computer networking : - 

physical layer : -  it work with bits streamign 

data layer : - work on the wrror was generated 

network : address resolution mean where it goes sourse address to destination address 

transport : - acknoledge ment provide you to packet generated is send or incomming packets send or not .

session : - when two sytem connectd it create  asesion and try to remain connected with that computer .

same process is hapen when data send to server same this layers happens .

presentation : - data manuplation import data compress , zip is donr by this layers .

application : - it help in resourse sharing .



-------------------------------TCP IP mODEL 


TCP : means transmission control protocal 
ip - internet protocol 

it a basic version on OSI model v2 . 


4/5 layer theu have 

practival model 

run over wan 





tcp 4 layer model : - 

application layer 
transport layer 
internet layer 
network Acess Layer 


in 5 layer model 

application - transport - internet layer - (data link layer - physical layer) is a netwotk layer in 4 version .
